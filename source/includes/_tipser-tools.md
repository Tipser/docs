# Tipser Tools

Tipser enables commerce on almost any site. An easy way to enable shopping on your site is to install the Tipser script and use the Tipser Tools to insert `Get The Look` widget directly into your content. The installation of the script on your site typically takes less than 5 minutes, and can be done by even non-technical people. 

To get Tipser Tools visit [www.tipser.com/pos/tools](https://www.tipser.com/pos/tools) and follow the instructions there.

Or, you create an empty bookmark in the bookmarks bar and insert the following script where the URL normally goes:

```
javascript:(function(){(typeof TipserBookmarklet!='undefined')?TipserBookmarklet.init():document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='//www.tipser.com/widget/bookmarklet.js?'+Math.random();}());
```

Once you have the Tipser Tools on your bookmark bar, simply click it to open on top of any other site.

## Get The Look
The `Get the look` (GTL) enables the user to add a list of products ( or a collection  in the legacy Tipser Widget) into a post, an article or a specific area on a page. The GTL is curated by clicking the `Insert Products` in the Tipser Tools (Bookmarklet).

You will be asked to pick products from all the inventory offered by Tipser and click the `generate snippet` button.

When the snippet is generated simply click the `copy` button and insert the snippet into your CMS or into your HTML code directly.

The product list will appear on your site exactly where you placed it, all products directly buyable.
