The installation of the script on your site typically takes less than 5 minutes, and can be done even by non-technical people.

You can also create an empty bookmark in the bookmarks bar and insert the following script where the URL normally goes:

```
javascript:(function(){(typeof TipserBookmarklet!='undefined')?TipserBookmarklet.init():document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='//www.tipser.com/widget/bookmarklet.js?'+Math.random();}());
```

Once you have the Tipser Tools on your bookmark bar, simply click it to open on top of any other site.
