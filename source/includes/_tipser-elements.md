# Tipser Elements
Tipser Elements is a React components library from Tipser enabling you to add shopable content to your site with minimal effort.  You can add simple components like products with buy buttons, collections of products and articles, but also more complex grids or whole pages.

The package allows you to use Tipser's product repository and create inline shops embedded into your pages as well as the entire websites.

`npx create-react-app my-app`
`cd my-app`

### Example inserting elements in your site
You can combine Tipser Elements with your own application

- `TipserElement` is a generic Element that can render any Contentful content that's fed as a prop to the element.
- `TipserProduct` is the Element that renders the product given the product ID as the prop.
- `CartIcon` is the Element that displays the number of items in your cart, as well as links to  checkout.
- `TipserContectProvider` takes care of putting the Tipser Elements app in context with the `tipserConfig` as props.


```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { TipserElement, TipserProduct, CartIcon, TipserContextProvider } from '@tipser/tipser-elements';

let tipserConfig = {
    posId: '59e86b79b8f3f60a94ecd26a',
    lang: 'en',
    env: 'prod',
    primaryColor: 'blue',
};

ReactDOM.render(
    <TipserContextProvider value = { tipserConfig }>   
        <header>
            <nav>
                <span>Nav Element</span>
                <CartIcon/>
            </nav>
        </header>
        <main>
            <TipserElement  id="1larHZb8TeMQiqmi4W8CIS" />
            <TipserProduct productId="5ba2334a781baa0001ccdffc"/>
        </main>
        <footer>
            <span>This is the footer</span>
        </footer>
    </TipserContextProvider>, 
    document.getElementById('root'));
```
> root is the id of the HTML element where the Tipser element goes


## Quick start with scripted injectable version
They are a ready-to-use out-of-the-box solution to be placed on your website, using React even though your own website doesnâ€™t.

### Script to be injected 
The script should be added in the body section of the page (as a last element preferably) Please see widget config section to get more details on configuration options.

```js
<script>
    var scriptTag = document.createElement('script');
    scriptTag.src = "https://cdn.tipser.com/tipser-script/latest.js";
    scriptTag.onload = scriptTag.onreadystatechange = function() {
        TIPSER.init({
            posId: 'your pos id',
            lang: 'en',
            tipserElementIdToBeMount: "id of the Tipser Element to be displayed",
            domElementSelectorWhereToMount: "the css selector of the element where Tipser Element will be mount",
            basePath: 'the url path to the page where the Tipser is displayed',
            domReplacementMode: false,
        });
    };
    document.body.appendChild(scriptTag);
</script>
```

### Available config options

```js  
    var widgetConfig = {
        posId: 'your pos id',
        lang: 'en',
        tipserElementIdToBeMount: "id of the Tipser Element to be displayed",
        domElementSelectorWhereToMount: "the css selector of the element where Tipser Element will be mount",
        basePath: 'the url path to the page where the Tipser is displayed',
        domReplacementMode: false, // shall we change data-tipser-pid and data-tipser-cid html tags to product / collections 
        env: 'prod', // what environment would you like to use
        openOldDialog: true,
        primaryColor: 'black',
        domElementSelectorWhereToMountCart: " if we want the shop, where to mount the shop cart icon"

        // HERE GOES ADDITIONAL WIDGET OPTIONS
    }; 
``` 

### Custom styling

## Usage mode 2 mounting the shop on the page 

If you need basic functionality of the shop you may use Tipser Elements as a library that will change your divs (marked with data-tipser-cid or data-tipser-pid attributes) into a buyable content. You should also add a cart icon to the page as well. We can achieve that in simply way by embedding the script within body tag:

```js
<script>
    var scriptTag = document.createElement('script');
    scriptTag.src = "https://cdn.tipser.com/tipser-script/latest.js";
    scriptTag.onload = scriptTag.onreadystatechange = function() {
        TIPSER.init({
            posId: 'your pos id',
            lang: 'en',
            basePath: 'the url path to the page where the Tipser is displayed',
            domReplacementMode: true,
            domElementSelectorWhereToMountCart: " if we want the shop, where to mount the shop cart icon"
        });
    };
    document.body.appendChild(scriptTag);
</script>
```

then you have to add to your page some divs with data-tipser-pid attribute for products and data-tipser-cid attributes for collections. Like this:

```html
<div data-tipser-pid="5ba2334a781baa0001ccdf61" />
```

Elements with attribute `data-tipser-pid` will be replaced with Tipser product component, using the product with Tipser id passed in the attribute.

```html
<p name="My collection" data-tipser-cid="5b2788909d25801adcb23f4f"
```

Elements with attribute `data-tipser-cid` will be replaced with Tipser collection component, using the collection with Tipser id passed in the attribute.
